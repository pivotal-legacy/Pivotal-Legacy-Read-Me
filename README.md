# Pivotal-Legacy-Read-Me
A brief description for the Pivotal Legacy Org


Due to larger efforts, this Org (previously called /pivotal), is actively being migrated to the new Pivotal consolidated org at: https://github.com/pivotal

Please do not let the name deceive you: **until moved, all repos in this org are still being actively worked on in this org**.

Any questions or concerns, please reach out to Andrew Bauer (onlyawave, abauer@pivotal.io) and I will be more than happy to assist.
